# Introduction

Ngorder provides API that can be used to integrate your system with our platform. The API is built based on REST concept and will return JSON formatted data upon your requests. In order to use our API, you must have an existing active shop in our application.


<!-- Welcome to the Kittn API! You can use our API to access Kittn API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation. -->

# Authentication

In order to use our API, you can securely authorize your application using either Key Authentication or OAuth 2, this key will be available if you are using our [**Platinum package**](https://app.ngorder.id/upgrade?app=platinum-12), if you're already using our Platinum package be sure to check your key as it's updated every year. Both authorization method provide access to the same API, only the endpoints are slightly different.

`https://api.ngorder.id/{specific-end-point}`

<!-- > To authorize, use this code: -->

<!-- ```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python

```shell

curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
